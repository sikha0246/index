            <div class="paragraph">
            <p>When Tony Stark died in Avengers: Endgame, fans all over the world were devastated by the loss of their favorite hero. The death of Iron Man came as a shock for a lot of viewers, but based on his actions in previous films, dying was the only option that made sense for Tony and not because Doctor Strange said it was their one shot at victory. 

                At the end of Iron Man 3, Tony claimed to have destroyed all his suits in an attempt to save his relationship with Pepper and put heroism behind him. When Avengers: Age of Ultron was released, Tony played a critical part in the events that unfolded, having both created Ultron and revealing that he couldn’t bring himself to get rid of the Iron Man suits entirely. The second installment of the Avengers franchise is crucial to Tony’s development because he's forced to acknowledge that he’s obsessed with creating new Stark technology and needs to have the tech in order to feel protected. Keeping his Iron Man persona pushes Pepper away, but Tony is willing to give up this relationship (for the time being) because he's more focused on being a hero and saving the world, especially since Ultron is one of his own creations gone bad.
